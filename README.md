# Exercise 2 PGR200

**How to run the application**

1.  First you start the server, this is done by opening 
    the ServerApplication-class and run this class. This
    class will call the class "DBCreator" create an database 
    and populate it with all the files within the "files" folder.

2.  Now you can open the ClientApplication class and run this. It will
    automatically connect to the server doe to the fact both server
    and client use the same "Properties"-file.
    

**What can you do with my application**

When you run the Client-class you will be prompted with some alternatives.
Here you can ask the server to send content of a table, print out all tables
in the Database, get metadata from a table and so on.
